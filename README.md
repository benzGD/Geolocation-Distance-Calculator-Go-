# Geolocation-Distance-Calculator-Go-
My attempt to make a full- stack Go application  featuring a clientside API, a coordinate database, and distance calculation (business) logic. 
This is just a prototype application; therefore, please use only names from the database. The names must match exactly, letter for letter, with those in the database, or the application will not work.
